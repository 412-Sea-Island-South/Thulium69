# Thulium Facts

# **The Story of Thulium**

The word Thulium (Symbol: *Tm*) originates from the name *Thule*, which was the earliest name for ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ Scandinavia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. It was discovered in 1879 by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve at a university in Sweden, who was also the one who discovered Holmium. He discovered it by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements. He started with *erbia,* the oxide of erbium ($Er_2O_3$), and removed all the known contaminants; this process left two new substances, one coloured green and the other brown. The green one was named *Thulia*, while the brown one was named *Holmia. Thulia* is the oxide of the element Thulium, and this is how the story of Thulium.

[Common Isotopes](https://www.notion.so/9ccbe1710fc347258c1badbdb5adf678)

There are many isotopes of Thulium, ranging from Thulium 145 to Thulium 179

[Relative Abundance](https://www.notion.so/063c4f8ebad04790b55b6e8f715995f5)

Thulium 169 is the only naturally occurring isotope of Thulium and there are few hundred thousand tonnes of it on Earth. It is mostly found in minerals like Monazite, which contains $0.007$ percent Thulium.

# Physical Properties at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure)

Thulium is a metal and is solid at STP. Its density is $9.321$ grams per centimeter cubed as a solid (and $8.56$  grams per centimeter cubed as a liquid), and it is soft and malleable; it can be cut easily with a knife. It has a Mohs Hardness of $2$-$3$ (which corresponds to a Brinell Hardness of $471$  megapascals) and Vickers Hardness of 520 megapascals. Its molar volume is approximately $0.000018126$. In colour, Thulium is a silvery-grey to white metal, and is stable in air, but pure Thulium tarnishes  in exposure to air, although more slowly than most rare earth metals. It is also ductile and can be easily shaped into a wire. Thulium has a boiling point of $3542^\circ$ Fahrenheit = $1950^\circ$ Celsius = $2223^\circ$ Kelvin and a melting point of $2813^\circ$ Fahrenheit = $1545^\circ$ Celsius = $1818^\circ$ Kelvin. It has a Bulk Modulus of $45$ gigapascals, a Young Modulus of $74$ gigapascals, and a Shear Modulus of $31$  gigapascals. Thuliumâ€™s Poisson Ratio is $0.21$.

# Family Group and Characteristics

Thulium is part of the Transition Metals, in the Lanthanide Series of rare-earth metals. It is the least abundant of the naturally occurring rare-earth metals. It reacts with all the Halogens (Group 17) as well as with hot and cold water to form hydroxide. It can also be dissolved in acids, and in diluted sulfuric acid, Thulium dissolves and forms a pale green solution. It is not a toxic element and does not have any signifiant effects on the environment, but it is radioactive. It has two allotropes, which are tetragonal alpha thulium and hexagonal beta thulium, the latter of which is more stable.

# Uses of Thulium

Thulium is relatively expensive and also quite rare (like $20+ per gram) and doesn't really have any commercial applications outside of chemistry experiments/use in labs. When irradiated in a nuclear reactor, Thulium 169 (or 170), an isotope of Thulium, emits x-rays. This allows it to be used in lightweight and portable x-ray machines in the medical industry. It is also used in lasers with surgical applications (i.e using lasers to treat diseases), as well as for doping fibre lasers. Specifically, it is used to dope YAGs (Yttrium Aluminum Garnets). It can also be used as a potential energy source due to it being slightly radioactive. Natural Thulium can also be used in ceramic magnetic materials which are used in microwaves. In addition, thulium-doped calcium sulphate has been used in personal radiation dosimeters because it can register especially low levels by its fluorescence. Another possible application of Thulium is in banknotes. Euro banknotes use thulium for its blue fluorescence under UV to detect counterfeits. Finally, Thulium can be used in alloys with other rare earth metals.
